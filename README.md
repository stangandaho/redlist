# IUCN Redlist API Wrapper

## About This Project

Started in September 2024, this project began while the [`rredlist`](https://github.com/ropensci/rredlist) 
package was still relying on the deprecated IUCN Red List V3 API. In January 2025, 
`rredlist` transitioned to support the V4 API, introducing significant changes.
Rather than adapting it, I chose to continue building on my original work â€” resulting in `redlist`, 
a standalone package that provides access to the Red List V4 API through a fresh, 
independent implementation with distinct design principles and workflows.

While both packages now use API V4, they differ significantly in implementation 
approach and output formatting. This is **NOT** a competing package, but rather 
an alternative implementation for users who prefer consistent tibble outputs for all endpoints.

## Installation

```r
# Install from GitHub using (required `pak` or `remotes` package)
pak::pkg_install("stangandaho/redlist") # Or remotes::install_github("stangandaho/redlist")
# Load
library(redlist)

# Get the first page (i.e first 100 records) of Critically Endangered species
cr_species <- rl_red_list_categories(code = "CR")
```
