\usage{
rl_scopes(
  code = NULL,
  year_published = NULL,
  latest = NULL,
  possibly_extinct = NULL,
  possibly_extinct_in_the_wild = NULL,
  scope_code = scope_code \%||\% NA,

}
\arguments{
\item{code}{Character or Numeric. One or more scope codes (e.g., "1", "2").
Use \code{\link[=rl_scopes]{rl_scopes()}} to list available scope categories.}

\item{year_published}{Optional. Single or numeric vector of years to filter assessments by publication year.}

\item{latest}{Optional. Logical. If \code{TRUE}, return only the latest assessment per species.}

\item{possibly_extinct}{Optional. Logical. Filter for species flagged as possibly extinct.}

\item{possibly_extinct_in_the_wild}{Optional. Logical. Filter for species possibly extinct in the wild.}

\item{scope_code}{Optional. Character. One or more scope codes to filter assessments.}

\item{page}{Optional. Integer vector. Specify one or more page numbers to fetch.
If \code{NULL} or \code{NA}, all pages will be fetched automatically.}

\item{pad_with_na}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, pad shorter columns with \code{NA} for consistent binding.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing assessment scopes or species assessments.
}
\description{
Retrieve species assessments based on their geographic assessment scopes.
If \code{code = NULL}, it returns a list of available assessment scopes.
If \code{code} is provided, it retrieves assessments for the specified scope(s).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# List all assessment scopes

# Get globally assessed species (code 1)
rl_scopes(code = "1")

# Get Pan-Africa species assessed species published since 2020
rl_scopes(
  code = "2",
  year_published = 2020:2023
)
