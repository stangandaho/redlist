\arguments{
\item{code}{Character Or Numeric. One or more research category codes (e.g., "1", "2").
Use \code{\link[=rl_research]{rl_research()}} to list available research categories.}

\item{year_published}{Optional. Single or numeric vector of years to filter assessments by publication year.}

\item{latest}{Optional. Logical. If \code{TRUE}, return only the latest assessment per species.}

\item{possibly_extinct}{Optional. Logical. Filter for species flagged as possibly extinct.}

\item{possibly_extinct_in_the_wild}{Optional. Logical. Filter for species possibly extinct in the wild.}

\item{scope_code}{Optional. Character. One or more scope codes to filter assessments.}

\item{page}{Optional. Integer vector. Specify one or more page numbers to fetch.
If \code{NULL} or \code{NA}, all pages will be fetched automatically.}

\item{pad_with_na}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, pad shorter columns with \code{NA} for consistent binding.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing research categories or species assessments.
}
\description{
Retrieve species assessments based on their research needs categories.
If \code{code = NULL}, it returns a list of available research categories.
If \code{code} is provided, it retrieves assessments for species with the specified research need(s).
}

# Get species needing life history & ecology research published since 2019
rl_research(
  code = "1_3",
  year_published = 2019:2023
