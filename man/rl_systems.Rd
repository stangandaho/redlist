}
\arguments{
\item{code}{Character or Numeric. One or more system codes (e.g., "0", "1", "2").
Use \code{\link[=rl_systems]{rl_systems()}} to list available ecological systems.}

\item{year_published}{Optional. Single or numeric vector of years to filter assessments by publication year.}

\item{latest}{Optional. Logical. If \code{TRUE}, return only the latest assessment per species.}

\item{possibly_extinct}{Optional. Logical. Filter for species flagged as possibly extinct.}

\item{possibly_extinct_in_the_wild}{Optional. Logical. Filter for species possibly extinct in the wild.}

\item{scope_code}{Optional. Character. One or more scope codes to filter assessments.}

\item{page}{Optional. Integer vector. Specify one or more page numbers to fetch.
If \code{NULL} or \code{NA}, all pages will be fetched automatically.}

\item{pad_with_na}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, pad shorter columns with \code{NA} for consistent binding.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing ecological systems or species assessments.
}
\description{
Retrieve species assessments based on their ecological systems.
If \code{code = NULL}, it returns a list of available ecological systems.
If \code{code} is provided, it retrieves assessments for species in the specified system(s).
}
\examples{
# List all ecological systems
rl_systems()

# Get terrestrial species assessments (code 0)
rl_systems(code = 0)

# Get marine species assessments published since 2021
rl_systems(
  code = "2",
  year_published = 2021:2023
)
