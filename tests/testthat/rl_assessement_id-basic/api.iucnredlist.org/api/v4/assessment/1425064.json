        "range": "This species is found in the eastern Atlantic from the coast of Namibia in the south to the southwest of Ireland in the north and in the northwestern Mediterranean at depths of 365â€“2,208 m (Collins and Villanueva 2006).",
        "population": "The population size of this species is unknown, however, it is suspected to be in decline because of the intense commercial bottom trawling in various regions. This species is taken (and discarded) by commercial bottom-trawling fisheries that have operated in areas occupied by this species for the last 30 years.&#160;Although values of population decline are not available, by inference, it is highly likely that the population size of this species declined by at least 30% over 15 years (approximately three generations, based on a&#160;conservative estimate of generation time considering the prolonged egg development period and extended spawning period following an initial period of growth to maturity) because of fishing impacts. This figure is reached by inference from the impacts of similar trawling activities on other species of this genus. Due to the low fecundity of this species, these declines may not be reversible.",
        "habitats": "There is very limited information available as to the habitat of this  species. Collins and Villanueva (2006) suggest that all members of the  Opisthoteuthidae are primarily benthic. Most specimens have been  collected from bottom trawls. Use of such gear is biased towards  soft sediments; consequently, it remains unclear whether the species  itself is biased towards soft sediments (Collins and Villanueva 2006).&#160;Cirrate octopods have several characteristics likely to make them rather slow to recover from population declines: longevity, slow growth and low fecundity. Embryonic development time has been estimated to range between 1.4 years and 2.6 years in three cirrate species based on models that incorporate egg size and water temperature, the shorter time being for a relatively shallow water species in warmer waters (Collins and Villanueva 2006). Studies of reproduction suggest a prolonged spawning period (with growth continuing during spawning) and eggs released one or two at a time (assumed because there are only ever one or two eggs in the distal oviduct). Eggs are thought to be laid singly on the sea floor and not brooded. Estimates of mean fecundity have been around 1,500 oocytes suggesting spawning may extend over multiple years, once reproductive maturity is reached. Difficulties of ageing cirrate octopods mean that no estimates for life span or generation length&#160;have been published, although Collins and Villanueva (2006) suggest that given the above factors, and the low metabolic rates of cephalopods in cold deep waters, the life cycle takes many years.",
        "threats": "Collins and Villanueva (2006) highlight the extension of commercial    fishing into deeper waters. This has yielded many cirrate octopod    specimens for research but the consequences of fishing mortality remains    unclear. These cephalopods are potentially long lived and slow to    reach maturity and Collins and Villanueva (2006) suggest that fishing    may already have significantly reduced population sizes in certain    areas. The genus&#160;<em>Opisthoteuthis<\/em>&#160;is the most shallow genus of cirrate octopods and is therefore the genus most affected directly by commercial deep-water trawling. Other cirrates inhabit generally greater depths, else their maximum depth is at least deeper and below the capacity of trawlers. In addition, unlike other cirrates, the behaviour and mode of life of the genus&#160;<em>Opisthoteuthis<\/em>&#160;is charaterized by a close association to the benthos (i.e., they are not pelagic or benthopelagic as other cirrates), making them more accessible and/or catchable by bottom trawling nets and therefore more vulnerable to deep-water trawling activities. This species is taken (and discarded) by commercial bottom-trawling fisheries, e.g. the hake fishery that operates off Namibia. There has been intensive bottom trawling in this area since the 1970s and intense trawling in the Northeast Atlantic in deeper waters since the 1980s (Priede <em>et al<\/em>. 2011) which has led to declines in finfish species. Drawing on evidence from other species within this genus, e.g., <em>Opisthoteuthis chathamensis<\/em> and <em>O. meroo<\/em> off New Zealand, even short periods of intensive trawling can decimate populations of&#160;<em>Opisthoteuthis,<\/em> and it is highly likely that <em>Opisthoteuthis calypso<\/em> has been severely impacted by deep-water&#160;trawling.",
        "measures": "There are no species-specific conservation measures in place. Research is required into the population size of this species, the trends in population size, and on the size of the take by deep-water fisheries and the effects of deep-water fisheries on the population size.",
        "use_trade": "This species is not used, but it is captured and probably discarded by commercial bottom-trawl fisheries throughout its range. Intense fishing occurs throughout its range in the Northeast Atlantic, Mediterranean and off Namibia.",
        "rationale": "<em>Opisthoteuthis calypso<\/em> has been assessed as Vulnerable because it is impacted by commercial fisheries as bycatch. Although population estimates are not available, similar levels of fishing decimated two congeneric species with similar biology off New Zealand and, by inference, it is likely that the population of this species declined by 30% over three generations. Fishing is ongoing, and because of the low fecundity and relative longevity of this species, population trends will be hard to reverse. Research is required to further assess population size and trends and the effect of the bycatch take.",
